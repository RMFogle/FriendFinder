# FriendFinder
Homework week-13


The FriendFinder app is a basic dating app. It's a full-stack site that will take in user inputs from a survey and then compare their answers with other users. Then the app will display the results: name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 


Heroku deployed app link: https://still-coast-70044.herokuapp.com/ 

Issues: 
1.) Having trouble with deploying app to Heroku. 
2.) App is not displaying the modal with best match data.
