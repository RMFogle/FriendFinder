# FriendFinder
Homework week-13


The FriendFinder app is a basic dating app. It's a full-stack site that will take in user inputs from a survey and then compare their answers with other users. Then the app will display the results: name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 


Heroku deployed app link: https://still-coast-70044.herokuapp.com/ 

Issues: 
1.) App returns same name for best match results regardless of user input. It always returns the third name in the object/array "Casey Park". Issue with most likey with my 'post request' in my 'apiRoutes.js' which is located in the 'routing' folder. 


Home page displays.
